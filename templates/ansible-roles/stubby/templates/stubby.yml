######################## STUBBY YAML CONFIG FILE ###############################
################################################################################
# This is a yaml version of the stubby configuration file (it replaces the
# json based stubby.conf file used in earlier versions of getdns/stubby).
#
# For more information see
# https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/Configuring+Stubby
#
# This format does not fully support all yaml features - the restrictions are:
#   - the outer-most data structure must be a yaml mapping
#   - mapping keys must be yaml scalars
#   - plain scalars will be converted to json unchanged
#   - non-plain scalars (quoted, double-quoted, wrapped) will be interpreted
#     as json strings, i.e. double quoted.
#   - yaml tags are not supported
#   - IPv6 addresses ending in :: are not yet supported (use ::0)
#
# Also beware that yaml is sensitive to the indentation at the start of each
# line so if you encounter errors when parsing the config file then please check
# that. We will add better checking but a useful online tool to check yaml
# format is here (it also converts yaml to json)
# https://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
#
# Note that we plan to introduce a more compact format for defining upstreams
# in future: https://github.com/getdnsapi/stubby/issues/79

################################### LOGGING ####################################
# Logging is currently configured at runtime using command line arguments. See
# > stubby -h
# for details.

########################## BASIC & PRIVACY SETTINGS ############################
# Specifies whether to run as a recursive or stub resolver
# For stubby this MUST be set to GETDNS_RESOLUTION_STUB
resolution_type: GETDNS_RESOLUTION_STUB

# Ordered list composed of one or more transport protocols:
# GETDNS_TRANSPORT_UDP, GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TCP or GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS
# If only one transport value is specified it will be the only transport used.
# Should it not be available basic resolution will fail.
# Fallback transport options are specified by including multiple values in the
# list.  Strict mode (see below) should use only GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS.
dns_transport_list:
  - GETDNS_TRANSPORT_TLS

# Selects Strict or Opportunistic Usage profile as described in
# https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-dprive-dtls-and-tls-profiles/
# Strict mode requires that authentication information for the upstreams is
# specified below. Opportunistic may fallback to clear text DNS if UDP or TCP
# is included in the transport list above.
# For Strict use        GETDNS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED
# For Opportunistic use GETDNS_AUTHENTICATION_NONE
tls_authentication: GETDNS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED

# EDNS0 option to pad the size of the DNS query to the given blocksize
# 128 is currently recommended by
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dprive-padding-policy-03
tls_query_padding_blocksize: 128

# EDNS0 option for ECS client privacy as described in Section 7.1.2 of
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7871
edns_client_subnet_private : 1

############################# CONNECTION SETTINGS ##############################
# Set to 1 to instruct stubby to distribute queries across all available name
# servers - this will use multiple simultaneous connections which can give
# better performance in most (but not all) cases.
# Set to 0 to treat the upstreams below as an ordered list and use a single
# upstream until it becomes unavailable, then use the next one.
round_robin_upstreams: 1

# EDNS0 option for keepalive idle timeout in milliseconds as specified in
# https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7828
# This keeps idle TLS connections open to avoid the overhead of opening a new
# connection for every query. Note that if a given server doesn't implement 
# EDNS0 keepalive and uses an idle timeout shorter than this stubby will backoff
# from using that server because the server is always closing the connection.
# This can degrade performance for certain configurations so reducing the
# idle_timeout to below that of that lowest server value is recommended.
idle_timeout: 9000

# Control the maximum number of connection failures that will be permitted
# before Stubby backs-off from using an individual upstream (default 2)
# tls_connection_retries: 5

# Control the maximum time in seconds Stubby will back-off from using an
# individual upstream after failures under normal circumstances (default 3600)
# tls_backoff_time: 300

# Specify the location for CA certificates used for verification purposes are
# located - this overrides the OS specific default location.
# tls_ca_path: "/etc/ssl/certs/"

# Limit the total number of outstanding queries permitted
# limit_outstanding_queries: 100

# Specify the timeout in milliseconds on getting a response to an individual
# request (default 5000)
# timeout: 1000

# Set the acceptable ciphers for DNS over TLS.  With OpenSSL 1.1.1 this list is
# for TLS1.2 and older only. Ciphers for TLS1.3 should be set with the
# tls_ciphersuites option. This option can also be given per upstream.
# tls_cipher_list: "EECDH+AESGCM:EECDH+CHACHA20"

# Set the acceptable cipher for DNS over TLS1.3. OpenSSL >= 1.1.1 is required
# for this option. This option can also be given per upstream.
# tls_ciphersuites: "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"

# Set the minimum acceptable TLS version. Works with OpenSSL >= 1.1.1 only.
# This option can also be given per upstream.
# tls_min_version: GETDNS_TLS1_2

# Set the maximum acceptable TLS version. Works with OpenSSL >= 1.1.1 only.
# This option can also be given per upstream.
# tls_max_version: GETDNS_TLS1_3

################################ LISTEN ADDRESS ################################
# Set the listen addresses for the stubby DAEMON. This specifies localhost IPv4
# and IPv6. It will listen on port 53 by default. Use <IP_address>@<port> to
# specify a different port
listen_addresses:
  - 0.0.0.0@55

############################### DNSSEC SETTINGS ################################
# Require DNSSEC validation. This will withhold answers with BOGUS DNSSEC
# status and answers that could not be validated (i.e. with DNSSEC status
# INDETERMINATE). Beware that if no DNSSEC trust-anchor is provided, or if
# stubby is not able to fetch and validate the DNSSEC trust-anchor itself,
# (using Zero configuration DNSSEC) stubby will not return answers at all.
# If DNSSEC validation is required, a trust-anchor is also required.
# dnssec: GETDNS_EXTENSION_TRUE

# Stubby tries to fetch and validate the DNSSEC root trust anchor on the fly
# when needed (Zero configuration DNSSEC), but only if it can store then
# somewhere.  The default location to store these files is the ".getdns"
# subdirectory in the user's home directory on Unixes, and the %appdata%\getdns
# directory on Windows. If there is no home directory, or
# the required subdirectory could not be created (or is not present), Stubby
# will fall back to the current working directory to try to store the
# trust-anchor files.
#
# When stubby runs as a special system-level user without a home directory
# however (such as in setups using systemd), it is recommended that an explicit
# location for storing the trust-anchor files is provided that is writable (and
# readable) by that special system user.
# appdata_dir: "/var/cache/stubby"

# When Zero configuration DNSSEC failed, because of network unavailability or
# failure to write to the appdata directory, stubby will backoff trying to
# refetch the DNSSEC trust-anchor for a specified amount of time  expressed
# in milliseconds (which defaults to two and a half seconds).
# trust_anchors_backoff_time: 2500

# Specify the location of the installed trust anchor file to override the 
# default location (see above)
# dnssec_trust_anchors: "/etc/unbound/getdns-root.key"


##################################  UPSTREAMS  ################################
# Specify the list of upstream recursive name servers to send queries to
# In Strict mode upstreams need either a tls_auth_name or a tls_pubkey_pinset
# so the upstream can be authenticated.
# The list below includes all the available test servers but only has the subset
# operated the stubby/getdns developers enabled. You can enable any of the
# others you want to use by uncommenting the relevant section. See:
# https://dnsprivacy.org/wiki/display/DP/DNS+Privacy+Test+Servers
# If you don't have IPv6 then comment then out those upstreams.
# In Opportunistic mode they only require an IP address in address_data.
# The information for an upstream can include the following:
# - address_data: IPv4 or IPv6 address of the upstream
#   port: Port for UDP/TCP (default is 53)
#   tls_auth_name: Authentication domain name checked against the server
#                  certificate
#   tls_pubkey_pinset: An SPKI pinset verified against the keys in the server
#                      certificate
#     - digest: Only "sha256" is currently supported
#       value: Base64 encoded value of the sha256 fingerprint of the public
#              key
#   tls_port: Port for TLS (default is 853)

# To always use the DHCP resolvers provided by the local network in Opportunistic
# mode then
# 1) In the dns_transport_list after TLS add UDP then TCP
# 2) Change to tls_authentication: GETDNS_AUTHENTICATION_NONE
# 3) Remove all the upstream_recursive_servers listed below

upstream_recursive_servers:
{% for server in stubby_upstream_servers %}
 - address_data: {{ server.ip_address }}
   tls_auth_name: "{{ server.tls_auth_name }}"
{% endfor %}
